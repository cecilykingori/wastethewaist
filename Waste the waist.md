\#\# Our Interventions

We offer a range of evidence-based medical interventions for weight loss.  

\#\#\# Sleeving the Past Behind â€” \*Gastric Sleeve\*    
A permanent surgical option where part of the stomach is removed, reducing capacity and promoting lasting weight loss. Ideal for patients struggling with obesity-related health issues.  

\#\#\# Inflate for Change â€” \*Gastric Balloons\*    
A non-surgical, minimally invasive option. A balloon is inserted into the stomach and inflated, creating a sense of fullness that helps regulate appetite and portion sizes.  

\#\#\# Meta Better â€” \*Pharmaceutical Intervention\*    
Prescription-based weight management using clinically approved medications. Tailored to individuals who may not be candidates for surgery but need medical support to accelerate weight loss.
